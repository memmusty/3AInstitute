                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>
                            This provides provides a documentation of my journey in the fourth fortnight. The fortnight's reflection highlights my growth in communicating abstract concepts to diverse audience through conscious team strategizing and ideating, to developing tic tac toe algorithms and translating the algorithms to programs that teach tic tac toe to computer agents with no prior experience. Prior to this fortnight, I had always played tic tac toe but had never really thought of explaining the strategy to agents with no experience and some language barrier. The following activities helped me reflect on and build my communication skills, especially to groups with absolutely different backgroun from mine.

                        <h3>Learning Resources</h3>
                        The skills session was preceded with learning about data, data collection process, PM2.5 Air quality sensor, and air quality definition and standards through reading these resources:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Chapter 2 of Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach by Russell and Norvig, 2016</li>
                            <li>An introduction to version control with <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a> material</li>
                            <li>Python developers community <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/">code of conduct</a></li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Key Skills</h3>
                        <ul>

                        <h4>Study and Define Tic Tac Toe strategy</h4>
                        <p>
                            For this activity, I was paired with Ned. This activity involved playing tic tac toe repeatedly with Ned, consciously noting his and my moves and decipher our strategies for winning the game. We took turns in playing as the first player and paid attention to the move we make as the first player, the move we makes as the second player, how we try to win the games and block the opponent from winning. Tic Tac Toe is a game I have been playing since I was a child, and this activity was rather an interesting one. Paying attention how I reason, strategize and restrategize based on my opponent's move, and also how I study his moves, try to figure out his strategies and predict his next move to determine the best winning strategy was an eye-opener on what we might want to think about when we document or communicate strategies.
                        </p>
                        <p>                             
                            Interestingly, when we tried to redefining the strategy for audiences with no experience playing tic tac toe. It became obvious that there are some level of assumptions we have about our audiences prior knowledge and our audiences shape the language we use in communicating abstract ideas.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Developing Algorithms for the Strategy</h4>
                        <p>
                            The strategy deviced from repeatedly playing tic tac toe with Ned was used in designing a flowchart describing strategy and the best move to take as the game progresses. This was later converted to a pseudocode for creating an intelligent tic tac toe agent.

                        <h3>Takeaway Lessons</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>AI and Machine learning: Not only machine learning systems are AI systems. AI agents are not limited to learning and taking deicions using machine learning algorithms</li>
                            <li>Team work is important - especially with diverse groups, they bring in multiple perspective.</li>
                            <li>
                                Detailed and proper documentation is important. When doing this, it is most important to put my audiences first, understand their language and have no assumptions about their prior knowledge or language. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Achievement</h3>
                        At the end of the activities, I:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Created an intelligent agents from ideating to programming</li> 
                            <li>Collaboratively contributed to a project of diverse team</li>
                            <li>Understand what goes into creating a simple agent from idea to executable code - understand how human assumptions, intuition, and strategic thinking get translated into computational agents</li>
                            <li>Learned the act of active and detailed documentation of my journey, experience, decision, assumptions when developing algorithms and systems whether personal ot shared.</li>
                        </ul>
                        These exercises equipped me with communication skills which I think are essential for every individual, especially those that will be contributing technically to social problems. Detailed and proper documentation makes it easier for me or any other person to be able to pick up my project, understand my thoughts and design process, and modify it accordingly - it is like a letter to someone in the future (it can be oneself). As I go on to tackling social problems, I see myself applying this in my algorithm design process, when coding, and communicating or sharing my work with others.
